## Computer Security:

Computer security is the process of detecting and blocking illegal access to your laptop or computer. It is the process of preventing trespassers from accessing your personal or office-based computer resources with malicious purpose or for personal benefit, or even accidently getting access to them.


##### Different Computer Security Elements:
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three fundamental components, with authenticity and utility recently added.

##### What is the CIA Triad, and why is it so important?
The CIA triad is a paradigm that depicts the three primary objectives that must be met in order to accomplish information security. While a number of factors influence the security of information systems and networks, a few stand out as particularly important. The assumption is that some aspects of information security will always be important.
1.	Confidentiality
2.	Integrity
3.	Availability

**Confidentiality:**
  
  - The withholding of information or resources is known as confidentiality. In addition, information must be kept secret from other third parties who desire access to it, so that only the appropriate persons have access.
- When it comes to a company's proprietary information, for example, secrecy takes precedence above integrity or availability. Also, when the information contains a record of people's personal actions, such as in cases involving personal and financial information of Google, Amazon, Apple, and Walmart consumers, secrecy is critical. Communication lines must be adequately monitored and regulated to avoid unwanted access under the CIA triad/trinity to ensure secrecy.

**Integrity:**
Integrity refers to the reliability of data in systems or resources in terms of preventing illegal or improper alterations. In general, integrity is made up of two sub-elements: data-integrity, which deals with the content of the data, and authentication, which deals with the data's provenance. Information only has value if it is correct.
**Eg:** Let's imagine you're making a 5 dollars online payment, but your information is tampered with without your awareness, resulting in a 500 dollars payment to the vendor.
Cryptography is crucial in preserving data integrity in this scenario. Hashing the data you receive and comparing it to the hash of the data you receive are two commonly used ways for protecting data integrity.

**Availability:**
The capacity to get data from a resource when it is needed is referred to as availability, because information has value only if authorised persons can access it at the appropriate moment. Denying access to data has become a prevalent assault in recent years. Consider how costly a downtime of a live server may be.
**Eg.** - Assume a hacker has gained access to a bank's web server and taken it offline. You wish to make an e-banking transfer as an authenticated user, but you can't access it; the undone transfer costs the bank money.


## CIA Triad's Implications:
The CIA trinity aims for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, all of which are important aspects of information security. Information security safeguards sensitive data against unauthorised access, modification, and distribution. To ensure success, the CIA trinity leads information security activities. There are times when one of the CIA triad's goals seems more irrational.

### **What Are Some Of The Advantages Of Cybersecurity?**
Defend from cyber-attacks by putting in place strong security measures that protect you on multiple levels.

•	It can secure your company, it offers full digital security for your company. This will allow your staff to browse the internet while remaining safe from potential hazards.
•	Keep personal information private, if a virus obtains personal information about your employees or customers, it can be sold or used to steal money.
•	Provide a safe working environment for employees - If your system, or even individual computers, become infected, it can severely impede their efficiency, forcing you to replace them.


•	**Boosted productivity**, Viruses can bring computers to a halt, making work nearly impossible. Effective cyber security reduces this risk, allowing your company to reach its full potential.
•	**Creates a sense of trust in customers**- If you can demonstrate that your company is well-protected against all types of cyber-attacks, you can give your customers confidence that their personal information will not be misused.
•	**Security for your clients** - Keeping your company safe from cyber-attacks will also help to safeguard your consumers, who may be vulnerable to a cyber-attack by proxy.
•	**Prevents the downtime of your website** - A cyber intrusion might be fatal for a company that runs its own website. If your system becomes infected, your website may be forced to close, causing you to lose money due to lost transactions.


*Even if security fails to prevent an attack or breach, it helps to speed up the recovery process. Customers and developers are typically more confident in goods that have strong cyber security measures in place, according to corporations.*



Cyber Crimes:
====

**Cybercrime Definition:** Cybercrime is a term used to describe a type of crime that occurs online.
Cybercrime is defined as a crime committed with the use of a computer as the means of perpetration. Cybercrime is a tool used to conduct a crime. A cybercriminal can utilise a device to gain access to a user's personal information, private corporate information, or government information, or to deactivate it. Selling or obtaining the aforesaid information via the internet is likewise a criminal.

The phrase "cyber crime" refers to an illegal behaviour in which computers or computing devices, such as smartphones, tablets, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and other stand-alone or networked devices, are used as a tool or target for criminal conduct. People with a destructive and criminal attitude are more likely to perpetrate crime, whether for revenge, greed, or adventure.


The cyber criminal could be from within or outside the organisation that is being attacked.
As a result, **cybercrime can be divided into two categories:**

•	**Insider Attack:**  Insider attack refers to an attack on a network or computer system by someone with authorised system access. It is usually carried out by disgruntled or unsatisfied internal employees or contractors. The insider attack could be motivated by vengeance or money. An insider may launch a cyber assault relatively easily since he is familiar with the company's policies, operations, and IT architecture.

•	**External Attack:** An external attack occurs when the attacker is hired by an insider or an external party to the organisation. When a company is the victim of a cyber assault, it suffers not only financial losses but also a loss of reputation. Because the attacker is not a part of the business, they normally scan and acquire information. An experienced network/security administrator is always on the lookout for new ways to improve things.

•	**Unstructured attacks:** These assaults are typically carried out by amateurs who have no predetermined motivations for carrying out the cyber attack. Typically, these amateurs attempt to test a freely available tool on the network of a random company.
•	**Structure Attack:** These attacks are carried out by highly competent and experienced individuals who have a good understanding of the objectives behind them. They have access to sophisticated tools and technologies that allow them to gain access to other networks without their Intrusion Detection Systems detecting them (IDSs). Furthermore, these attackers possess the necessary skill to create or adapt existing tools to meet the requirements.


### **Many factors contribute to the rise of cybercrime. Here are a handful of the most notable:**

•	**Money:** The desire to make quick and easy money motivates people to engage in cybercrime.

•	**Revenge:** Some people seek vengeance on another person, organisation, group, caste, or religion by slandering their reputation or causing financial or physical harm to them. This is classified as cyber terrorism.


•	**Fun:** Cybercrime is done for amusement by amateurs. They simply want to put their new tool to the test.



•	**Recognition:** When someone hacks highly secured networks such as defence sites or networks, hacking is considered a source of pride.


•	**Anonymity:** The anonymity that a cyber space provides often inspires people to conduct cyber crime because it is much easier to perform a cyber crime over the cyber space while remaining anonymous than in the actual world.



###Types of Cybercrimes:

Cybercrime types like Password Related Crimes,Desktop Related Crimes, Network Related Crimes, Social Networking Sites Related Crimes, Website Related Crimes, Social Engineering Related Crimes, Wi-Fi Related Crimes, Other kind of Cyber Crimes, Online Banking Frauds and Mitigation.

#### Several types of cybercrime are:

1.	**Cyber Stalking:** It is stalking, harassing, or threatening someone through the use of the Internet or computer. This is frequently done to malign a person, and it involves the use of email, social media, instant chat, web-posting, and other forms of Internet communication that provide anonymity. False allegations, threats, sexual exploitation of youngsters, monitoring, and other forms of misconduct are examples of this type of behaviour.

2.	**Terrorism:** using the Internet It is described as the use of computer resources to frighten or compel government officials, the civilian population, or any sector thereof, in order to achieve political or social goals.
3.	**Vandalism:** on the computer It is the act of physically damaging computing resources through the use of physical force or malicious software.
4.	**Piracy of software and other crimes** involving intellectual property rights The illicit reproduction and dissemination of software for personal or commercial purposes is known as software piracy. It is classified as a felony involving infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR). Downloading songs, downloading movies, and other forms of IPR violation are examples.
5.	**Hacking** a computer It is the process of altering computer hardware and software to achieve a goal that is not intended by the designer. Hacking a computer system can be used for a variety of reasons, from demonstrating technical proficiency to encrypting, changing, or destroying data for social, economic, or political objectives. Hackers, a person who engages in malicious behaviour, are now being hired by corporations.
