## Computer Security:

Computer security is the process of detecting and blocking illegal access to your laptop or computer. It is the process of preventing trespassers from accessing your personal or office-based computer resources with malicious purpose or for personal benefit, or even accidently getting access to them.


##### Different Computer Security Elements:
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three fundamental components, with authenticity and utility recently added.

##### What is the CIA Triad, and why is it so important?
The CIA triad is a paradigm that depicts the three primary objectives that must be met in order to accomplish information security. While a number of factors influence the security of information systems and networks, a few stand out as particularly important. The assumption is that some aspects of information security will always be important.
1.	Confidentiality
2.	Integrity
3.	Availability

**Confidentiality:**
  
  - The withholding of information or resources is known as confidentiality. In addition, information must be kept secret from other third parties who desire access to it, so that only the appropriate persons have access.
- When it comes to a company's proprietary information, for example, secrecy takes precedence above integrity or availability. Also, when the information contains a record of people's personal actions, such as in cases involving personal and financial information of Google, Amazon, Apple, and Walmart consumers, secrecy is critical. Communication lines must be adequately monitored and regulated to avoid unwanted access under the CIA triad/trinity to ensure secrecy.

**Integrity:**
Integrity refers to the reliability of data in systems or resources in terms of preventing illegal or improper alterations. In general, integrity is made up of two sub-elements: data-integrity, which deals with the content of the data, and authentication, which deals with the data's provenance. Information only has value if it is correct.
**Eg:** Let's imagine you're making a 5 dollars online payment, but your information is tampered with without your awareness, resulting in a 500 dollars payment to the vendor.
Cryptography is crucial in preserving data integrity in this scenario. Hashing the data you receive and comparing it to the hash of the data you receive are two commonly used ways for protecting data integrity.

**Availability:**
The capacity to get data from a resource when it is needed is referred to as availability, because information has value only if authorised persons can access it at the appropriate moment. Denying access to data has become a prevalent assault in recent years. Consider how costly a downtime of a live server may be.
**Eg.** - Assume a hacker has gained access to a bank's web server and taken it offline. You wish to make an e-banking transfer as an authenticated user, but you can't access it; the undone transfer costs the bank money.
