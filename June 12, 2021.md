## Computer Security:

Computer security is the process of detecting and blocking illegal access to your laptop or computer. It is the process of preventing trespassers from accessing your personal or office-based computer resources with malicious purpose or for personal benefit, or even accidently getting access to them.


##### Different Computer Security Elements:
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three fundamental components, with authenticity and utility recently added.

##### What is the CIA Triad, and why is it so important?
The CIA triad is a paradigm that depicts the three primary objectives that must be met in order to accomplish information security. While a number of factors influence the security of information systems and networks, a few stand out as particularly important. The assumption is that some aspects of information security will always be important.
1.	Confidentiality
2.	Integrity
3.	Availability

**Confidentiality:**
  
  - The withholding of information or resources is known as confidentiality. In addition, information must be kept secret from other third parties who desire access to it, so that only the appropriate persons have access.
- When it comes to a company's proprietary information, for example, secrecy takes precedence above integrity or availability. Also, when the information contains a record of people's personal actions, such as in cases involving personal and financial information of Google, Amazon, Apple, and Walmart consumers, secrecy is critical. Communication lines must be adequately monitored and regulated to avoid unwanted access under the CIA triad/trinity to ensure secrecy.

**Integrity:**
Integrity refers to the reliability of data in systems or resources in terms of preventing illegal or improper alterations. In general, integrity is made up of two sub-elements: data-integrity, which deals with the content of the data, and authentication, which deals with the data's provenance. Information only has value if it is correct.
**Eg:** Let's imagine you're making a 5 dollars online payment, but your information is tampered with without your awareness, resulting in a 500 dollars payment to the vendor.
Cryptography is crucial in preserving data integrity in this scenario. Hashing the data you receive and comparing it to the hash of the data you receive are two commonly used ways for protecting data integrity.

**Availability:**
The capacity to get data from a resource when it is needed is referred to as availability, because information has value only if authorised persons can access it at the appropriate moment. Denying access to data has become a prevalent assault in recent years. Consider how costly a downtime of a live server may be.
**Eg.** - Assume a hacker has gained access to a bank's web server and taken it offline. You wish to make an e-banking transfer as an authenticated user, but you can't access it; the undone transfer costs the bank money.


## CIA Triad's Implications:
The CIA trinity aims for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, all of which are important aspects of information security. Information security safeguards sensitive data against unauthorised access, modification, and distribution. To ensure success, the CIA trinity leads information security activities. There are times when one of the CIA triad's goals seems more irrational.

### **What Are Some Of The Advantages Of Cybersecurity?**
Defend from cyber-attacks by putting in place strong security measures that protect you on multiple levels.

•	It can secure your company, it offers full digital security for your company. This will allow your staff to browse the internet while remaining safe from potential hazards.
•	Keep personal information private, if a virus obtains personal information about your employees or customers, it can be sold or used to steal money.
•	Provide a safe working environment for employees - If your system, or even individual computers, become infected, it can severely impede their efficiency, forcing you to replace them.


•	**Boosted productivity**, Viruses can bring computers to a halt, making work nearly impossible. Effective cyber security reduces this risk, allowing your company to reach its full potential.
•	**Creates a sense of trust in customers**- If you can demonstrate that your company is well-protected against all types of cyber-attacks, you can give your customers confidence that their personal information will not be misused.
•	**Security for your clients** - Keeping your company safe from cyber-attacks will also help to safeguard your consumers, who may be vulnerable to a cyber-attack by proxy.
•	**Prevents the downtime of your website** - A cyber intrusion might be fatal for a company that runs its own website. If your system becomes infected, your website may be forced to close, causing you to lose money due to lost transactions.


*Even if security fails to prevent an attack or breach, it helps to speed up the recovery process. Customers and developers are typically more confident in goods that have strong cyber security measures in place, according to corporations.*



Cyber Crimes:
====

**Cybercrime Definition:** Cybercrime is a term used to describe a type of crime that occurs online.
Cybercrime is defined as a crime committed with the use of a computer as the means of perpetration. Cybercrime is a tool used to conduct a crime. A cybercriminal can utilise a device to gain access to a user's personal information, private corporate information, or government information, or to deactivate it. Selling or obtaining the aforesaid information via the internet is likewise a criminal.

The phrase "cyber crime" refers to an illegal behaviour in which computers or computing devices, such as smartphones, tablets, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and other stand-alone or networked devices, are used as a tool or target for criminal conduct. People with a destructive and criminal attitude are more likely to perpetrate crime, whether for revenge, greed, or adventure.


The cyber criminal could be from within or outside the organisation that is being attacked.
As a result, **cybercrime can be divided into two categories:**

•	**Insider Attack:**  Insider attack refers to an attack on a network or computer system by someone with authorised system access. It is usually carried out by disgruntled or unsatisfied internal employees or contractors. The insider attack could be motivated by vengeance or money. An insider may launch a cyber assault relatively easily since he is familiar with the company's policies, operations, and IT architecture.

•	**External Attack:** An external attack occurs when the attacker is hired by an insider or an external party to the organisation. When a company is the victim of a cyber assault, it suffers not only financial losses but also a loss of reputation. Because the attacker is not a part of the business, they normally scan and acquire information. An experienced network/security administrator is always on the lookout for new ways to improve things.

•	**Unstructured attacks:** These assaults are typically carried out by amateurs who have no predetermined motivations for carrying out the cyber attack. Typically, these amateurs attempt to test a freely available tool on the network of a random company.
•	**Structure Attack:** These attacks are carried out by highly competent and experienced individuals who have a good understanding of the objectives behind them. They have access to sophisticated tools and technologies that allow them to gain access to other networks without their Intrusion Detection Systems detecting them (IDSs). Furthermore, these attackers possess the necessary skill to create or adapt existing tools to meet the requirements.


### **Many factors contribute to the rise of cybercrime. Here are a handful of the most notable:**

•	**Money:** The desire to make quick and easy money motivates people to engage in cybercrime.

•	**Revenge:** Some people seek vengeance on another person, organisation, group, caste, or religion by slandering their reputation or causing financial or physical harm to them. This is classified as cyber terrorism.


•	**Fun:** Cybercrime is done for amusement by amateurs. They simply want to put their new tool to the test.



•	**Recognition:** When someone hacks highly secured networks such as defence sites or networks, hacking is considered a source of pride.


•	**Anonymity:** The anonymity that a cyber space provides often inspires people to conduct cyber crime because it is much easier to perform a cyber crime over the cyber space while remaining anonymous than in the actual world.



###Types of Cybercrimes:

Cybercrime types like Password Related Crimes,Desktop Related Crimes, Network Related Crimes, Social Networking Sites Related Crimes, Website Related Crimes, Social Engineering Related Crimes, Wi-Fi Related Crimes, Other kind of Cyber Crimes, Online Banking Frauds and Mitigation.

#### Several types of cybercrime are:

1.	**Cyber Stalking:** It is stalking, harassing, or threatening someone through the use of the Internet or computer. This is frequently done to malign a person, and it involves the use of email, social media, instant chat, web-posting, and other forms of Internet communication that provide anonymity. False allegations, threats, sexual exploitation of youngsters, monitoring, and other forms of misconduct are examples of this type of behaviour.

2.	**Terrorism:** using the Internet It is described as the use of computer resources to frighten or compel government officials, the civilian population, or any sector thereof, in order to achieve political or social goals.
3.	**Vandalism:** on the computer It is the act of physically damaging computing resources through the use of physical force or malicious software.
4.	**Piracy of software and other crimes** involving intellectual property rights The illicit reproduction and dissemination of software for personal or commercial purposes is known as software piracy. It is classified as a felony involving infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR). Downloading songs, downloading movies, and other forms of IPR violation are examples.
5.	**Hacking** a computer It is the process of altering computer hardware and software to achieve a goal that is not intended by the designer. Hacking a computer system can be used for a variety of reasons, from demonstrating technical proficiency to encrypting, changing, or destroying data for social, economic, or political objectives. Hackers, a person who engages in malicious behaviour, are now being hired by corporations.

     -  - **Hackers can be categorised into the following categories:**
    

        
         
            **White Hat:** A white hat is a type of hat that is used to identify Hackers are those who break into a system to discover security flaws and alert companies so that preventative measures can be done to secure the system from outside hackers. White hat hackers can be salaried employees of a company hired to uncover security flaws, or they might be freelancers looking to establish their reputation in the industry.

 

            **Black Hat:** Unlike white hats, black hats hack the system with malicious intent. They could use the system to further social, political, or economic goals. They discover security flaws in the system, preserve the information, and exploit the system for personal or organisational gain until the company whose system has been compromised becomes aware of the problem and implements security measures. 	

            **Grey Hat:** Grey hat hackers discover security flaws and notify site managers, offering to remedy the fault for a price.

            **Blue hat hacker:** A blue hat hacker is a person who works outside of computer security consulting businesses to bug-test a system before it is released, seeking for flaws to close.

**6.Viruses** are created and spread over the internet, A virus's spread might result in a company's loss of revenue and profits. The cost of fixing the system, as well as the cost of lost business and missed opportunities, are all included in the loss. If the hacker is discovered, the organisation has the right to sue for a sum equal to or more than the loss it has suffered.


**7.Spamming** is the practise of sending bulk unsolicited commercial messages via the internet.

  If an email satisfies the following characteristics, it is considered spam:  

       a.	The email is sent to a huge number of people rather than one specific  individual.


       b.	Anonymity: The person's true identity is unknown.


       c.	Unsolicited: the email was not expected or asked for by the recipient.


**8. Thefts of Internet Time Hacking-** is when someone steals a person's ISP account and password and surfs the internet at his expense.

**9. Denial of Service (DoS) assault,** by overloading the network with worthless traffic, the network is clogged and often collapses, prohibiting legitimate network traffic.

**10. Spoofing an email** It is the process of altering the header information of an e-mail such that the original source is obscured and the email looks to have originated from a source other than the real source to the recipient.

# Passwords:

**What does a password entail?**
• A password is a word, phrase, or string of characters used to distinguish between permitted and unauthorised users or processes.
• A password is used to verify an individual's identity or to grant access to a resource.

**Password Storing Methods:**
  -The safe storage of passwords is always a worry.
   -But what are the most common ways, how do they operate, and how valuable are them in comparison to current password cracking techniques? The most important aspects of safe storage are: (hash, salt, pepper, iteration)


**GENERATING SECURE PASSWORD:**

Many individuals find it difficult to choose the correct password; there are so many things that require passwords these days that remembering them all may be a real challenge. Perhaps as a result of this, many people make poor password choices.


**Simple guidelines for selecting a strong password:**


**Basics:**

  • Use at least eight characters; the more the better, but most people will have trouble remembering anything more than roughly 15 characters.
  • Mix upper and lower case letters, numerals, punctuation, spaces, and symbols at random.
  • Don't use a dictionary word, whether it's English or foreign.
  • Don't use the same password more than once.



**Things to avoid:**
    •	Don't just slap a single digit or symbol in front of or behind a word. "Apple1," for instance.

    •	Do not repeat a single word. E.g."Appleapple,"

    •	Reversing a word is not sufficient. e.g. "elppa"

    •	Don't just take away the vowels. e.g. "ppl" 

    •	Easy-to-repeat key sequences. e.g. "qwerty","asdf" etc.

    •	Don't just garble letters, e.g.   converting e to 3, L or i to 1, o to 0. as in "z3r0-10v3"




**Tips**
  
  •	Choose a password that you can remember so you don't have to look it up all the time; this decreases the risk of someone finding out where you wrote it down.
  •	Pick a password that you can type rapidly to limit the chances of someone peeking over your shoulder learning your password.


**Bad Passwords:**

  •	Don't use passwords that contain personal information like your name, nickname, birthdate, wife's name, pet's name, friends' names, hometown, phone number, social security number, car registration number, or address. This includes only utilising a portion of your name or only a portion of your birthdate.
  •	Don't use passwords that are based on nearby objects. Passwords like "computer," "monitor," "keyboard," "telephone," and "printer," among others, are ineffective.
  •	Never use one of those oh-so-common passwords that are simple to remember but provide no security. "Password," "letmein," and "12345678," for example.
  •	Don't use your login, account name, or email address as a password.

  
**Bad Examples:**


   "leo8" - It's also too short based on the user's name.
   "Alia" - The easy-to-guess name of the user's    girlfriend.
   "legna" - Backwards spelling of the user's name
   "indescribable" - A word that is listed in a dictionary
   "iNdesCribaBle" - Adding random capitalization isn't going to make it safe.
   "almost" -  A word listed in lists of word lists
   "zeolite" – A word which is enumerated in a geological encyclopaedia
   "qwerty" - A word listed in lists of word lists 
   "merde!" - A word that appears in a lists of foreign language dictionary


**Good Examples:**
None of these good password examples are genuinely good passwords; this is because they've been published here and everyone knows what they are. Always choose your own password, rather than relying on someone else's.

   •	"SItHdOtW4Me" - Sunday is the Happy day of the week for me.



**In any case, how would a hacker obtain my password?**

One of the most popular types of business and personal data breaches is assword attacks. When a hacker attempts to steal your password, this is known as a password attack. The majority of data breaches occurred as a result of compromised credentials. Passwords are becoming less secure since they can only hold so many letters and numbers. Because hackers are aware that many passwords are badly crafted, password attacks will continue to be utilised as long as passwords are utilised.

**The following are the main methods that hackers can use to obtain your password:**



**1.	Steal it:**

 That means checking your spelling while you type it, or looking for the piece of paper where you typed it down. Because this is the most common way passwords are stolen, it's critical that if you do write down your password, you keep the paper in a secure location. Also, don't type your password if you think someone is looking.


**2.	Guess it:**

 It's remarkable how many individuals use passwords based on easily guessed information. According to psychologists, most men use four-letter obscenities as passwords, whereas most women use their boyfriends', spouses', or children's names.


**3.  Phishing:**

 Phishing occurs when a hacker poses as a trustworthy entity and sends you a bogus email in the hopes that you will voluntarily disclose your personal information. They may take you to a false "reset your password" screen, or they may download harmful code to your device.

 
   **examples** *of Phishing is a type of fraud that occurs when someone sends you an email that:*

   -	**Phishing on a regular basis:**  Consistent phishing: You receive an email from wingiftswebsite.com requesting that you reset your password, but it's actually wingiftswobsite.com. After you "updated your password," the hacker steals your credentials

   -	**Spear phishing** is a sort of phishing assault in which a hacker sends you an email pretending to be a friend, coworker, or associate. The message is brief and generic and wishes for you to open the malicious attachment.

   -	**Smishing and vishing** are two terms that are often used interchangeably in the same sentence: A hacker sends you a text message (smishing) or calls you (voice phishing, or vishing), stating that your account has been frozen or that fraud has been uncovered. Once you provide your account details, the hacker has it.



   - **Whale Hunting:** An email purporting to be from a senior figure in your firm is sent to you or your organisation. You don't do your homework and give crucial information to a hacker since you didn't do your homework on the email's validity.



**4. A brute force attack:**

     This is where you can try every conceivable combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to figure out the password. Although this is a time-consuming procedure, with today's fast processors and software tools, this method should not be overlooked.

  **To help prevent brute force attacks:**

  - **To help prevent brute force attacks** choose a complicated password. A six-digit password that is all lowercase, all alphabetic, is radically different from a ten-digit password that is mixed case, mixed characters. As your password becomes more complicated, the chances of a successful brute force attack decreases.
  - **Enable and configure remote access:** Check with your IT department if your company uses remote access management.
  - **Make multi-factor authentication a requirement:** A potential hacker can only request access to your account if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is configured on your account. Hackers won't to have the ability to access your account because they is not going to be able to use your smartphone or thumbprint.


**5.Man-in-the-middle attack**

    Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks occur when a hacker or compromised system sits in the middle of two uncompromised persons or systems and decodes the information they're passing between them, including passwords. Selena gets the option to be the guy in the middle if Ram and Krish are passing notes in class and Selena must relay those notes.

   **To help avoid man-in-the-middle attacks, implement the following measures:**

     •	Encryption should be enabled on your router. If anyone on the street has access to your modem and router, they can use "sniffer" equipment to see the data that passes through it.
   
     •	Use two-factor authentication and strong credentials. The default login and password for many routers are never changed. If a hacker gains access to your router's admin panel, they can divert all of your traffic to their compromised servers.

     •	Connect to the internet over a virtual private network, or VPN. By guaranteeing that all of the servers you transfer data to are trusted, a secure virtual private network (VPN) can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.


###Defending against password breaches: 

   **The simplest method to avoid a password attack in the first place is to avoid it altogether:**

     •	Authentication using several factors. Authenticating users with a physical token (such as a Yubikey) or a personal device (such as a phone) ensures that passwords aren't the only way in.Remote access. 

     •	When you utilise a smart remote access platform like OneLogin, you eliminate the need for users to trust specific websites. OneLogin, on the other hand, verifies the user's identification before allowing them to log in.

     •	Biometrics is a term that refers to the measurement of a It will be extremely difficult for a malevolent actor to imitate your fingerprint or facial form. When you enable biometric authentication, your password becomes just one of multiple sources of trust a hacker must overcome.


**USING PASSWORD MANAGER AND ITS APPLICATIONS**
  
  To keep our data safe and secure, we employ passwords. Identity theft is one of the most common crimes in today's world, and it's easy to commit when credentials are stolen. Good password management is essential these days. Have you considered a method for remembering your passwords and avoiding having to enter your login details again and over? One of the better tools is a password manager.

## What is the purpose of a password manager? 

   -	A password manager is a programme that helps you keep track of your passwords. 
   -	A password manager is software that allows a user to manage passwords and other vital data so that it may be accessed at any time and from any location. A good password manager aids in the secure storage of information without jeopardising security. All passwords are encrypted to make them difficult to crack.


  
**Why should you make advantage of it?** If you have trouble remembering passwords for every website and don't want to keep going through the "forgot password?" process, a password organiser is what you need. These are intended to store a variety of important login information for several websites.
