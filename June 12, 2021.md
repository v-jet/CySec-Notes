## Computer Security:

Computer security is the process of detecting and blocking illegal access to your laptop or computer. It is the process of preventing trespassers from accessing your personal or office-based computer resources with malicious purpose or for personal benefit, or even accidently getting access to them.


##### Different Computer Security Elements:
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the three fundamental components, with authenticity and utility recently added.
